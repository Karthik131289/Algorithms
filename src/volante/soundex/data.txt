A dictionary is a book which explains the meanings of words or, more precisely, lexemes
The words are arranged in alphabetical order so that they can be found quickly. The word 
"dictionary" comes from the Latin "dictio" ("saying").

There are several types of dictionaries: dictionaries which explain words and how they 
are used, dictionaries which translate words from one langauge to another, dictionaries 
of biography which tell about famous people, technical dictionaries which explain the 
meanings of technical words or words connected to a particular subject (sometimes called
a thesaurus). Some of these come close to being an encyclopedia, but an encyclopedia gives a lot
of extra information about things (knowledge) and does not explain the use of the language.

Dictionaries which explain what words mean will give a clear "definition" of the word 
(e.g. hippopotamus : a hoofed mammal with thick skin, large mouth and short legs that 
lives in rivers and lakes of Africa.)

A big dictionary will also give more information about the word. It will explain how it 
is pronounced. Usually the International Phonetic Alphabet is used for this. It will 
explain how the word is used. This is not a problem for a word like "hippopotamus", but 
a word like "put" has so many different meanings that a large dictionary may have a whole
page or more to explain how it can be used. It will also explain what language the word 
comes from (e.g. Greek "hippos" horse and "potamus" river).

A dictionary may also give the form of the word in different tenses, plural form etc.
